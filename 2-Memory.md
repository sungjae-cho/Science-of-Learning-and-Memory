# Memory

## The fragile power of memory

- Bottom-up and Top-down Influences on Memory
  - Bottom-up
    - Perceptual experience
    - What we seee and hear
  - Top-down
    - Prior knowledge, concepts, beliefs, expectations, subsequent experience
- A memory is the *mixture* of
  - a perceptual experience,
  - the knowledge that interprets that experience, and
  - the subsequent use of that memory.

## The 3-stage of model of memory

- Stages: Sensory memory -> Short-term memory -> Long-term memory
- Duration: sensory < short-term < long-term
- Capacity: short-term < sensory < long-term

## Sensory memory

- Sensory memory is extremely brief and allows us to remember sights, sounds, and smells immediately after they occur.
- **Sperling test**
  - People are more likely to remember any given letter in the grid if they are cued to the row that it was in.
- Sensory memory has a larger capacity than short-term memory.
- Sensory memory requires attention to be converted into short-term memory.

## Short-term memory

- Short-term memory has a very limited capacity.
- Short-term memory remembers about 7+-2 piecies, or "chuncks", of information.
- Pior knowledge defines chuncks, allows for more information to be retained in memory, and may misocde information.
- Chuncking may be an exemplary result of hierarchical neocortical structures.

- Short-term memory + repetition/rehearsal/practice -> Long-term memory
- Prior knowledge can improve or impair short-term memory, depending on the situation.

## Long-term memory

- [Sequential Stage100s of Long-Term Memory](images/seq-stages-LTM.png)
  - Encoding -> Storange -> Retrieval

## Memory enocding

- **Primacy effect**: affected by long-term memory
- **Recency effect**: affected by short-term memory
- [The effect of attention on memory](images/STM-effect-of-attention.png)
  - In everyday life, our short-term memories is about three things.
  - If you are focused, then you can remember about six things.

- [Spacing effect](images/spacing-effect.png)
- [Retrieval practice effect](images/retrieval-practice-effect.png)
  - Study-Study-Test < Study-Test-Test
    - Even, test does not correct your answers.
  - Early study/test > Late study/test
    - Early retrieval helps to remember.
- Focusing on meaning leads to better retrieval.
  - [Depth of semantic processing](images/depth-of-semantic-processing.png)
    - Repetition -> Better retrieval
    - Better retrieval: Visual appearance < Sound < Meaning
- [Encoding specificity](images/encoding-specificity.png)
  - Words learned in a certain context can be retrieved easier if located in that context.
  - Evidence from the surroundings can lead to better retrieval.

## Forgetting and interference

- **Passive forgetting**: Fading away.
- **Interference**: Messed up.
  - [Retroactive interference](images/retroactive-interference.png)
    - Current memory formation interferes past memory.
  - [Proactive interference](images/proactive-interference.png)
    - Past memory interferes current memory formation.
- All memories are susceptible to interference and distortion.
- Interesting topic! I should read textbooks on this topic.


## The strength of memory

- Having a nearly perfect memory creates problems with prioritizing and recalling more important details.
- [Remarkable human memory](images/remarkable-human-memory.png)
  - The human brain excels at remembering whether an image has seen previously.

## Retroactive interference and false memories

- **Flashbulb memory**
  - People tend to be overconfident in their memory for highly emotional events.
  - Experience involved strong emotion is vulnerable to retroactive interference, leading to false memories.
- Humans make up consistent, plausible false memories.
- Convictions and eyewitnesses are likely to be false.
