# Amnesia

## Introduction to memory

- **Amnesia** refers to a condition characterized by memory loss,
  - where an individual is unable to recall past experiences, events, or information or has difficulty forming new memories.
  - It is not a disease itself but rather a symptom of an underlying condition.
- **Antetrograde amnesia**.
  - Inability to form new long-term memories
  - Preserving past memories
- **Retrograde amnesia**.
  - Losing past memories
  - Preserving new memory formation
- Many different parts of the brain contribute to our memory experience.

## Distributed memory

- **Engram** is what changes biologically in your brain to form a new memory.
- [Lashley experiment](images/Lashley-experiment.png)
  - More cortical brain removed results in worse learning.
  - Memories are widely distributed across the neocortex

## H.M. (Features of Case)

- Seizure: Neurons start to fire for no good reason and to excite other neurons.
- H.M.'s hippocampus was removed to alleviate severe seizures.
- Without hippocampus, he cannot form memory again.
  - An example of antetrograde amnesia.
  - He could not tell you a story over 3 minutes.
  - He also suffered from partial retrograde amnesia.

## STM vs. LTM

- How to measure STM and LTM?
  - The number of words retrieved
- [How to measure whether LSTM/STM is impaired](images/STM-LTM-impairment-test.png)
- Repetion does not improve STM. -> Problems in LTM.
- [Right and left hippocampus (HC) has different roles](images\removal-HC.png).
  - Remove left HC: verbal STM (O), verbal LTM (X), effect on right HC (X)
  - Remove right HC: visual-sptial STM (O), visual-spatial LTM (X), effect on left HC (X)

## Episodic vs. semantic memory

- [Memory classification](images/memory-classification.png)
- Episodic memory
  - Experienced stories
- Semantic memory
  - Abstract concepts
- HM's semantic memory was as bad as episodic memory.

## Role of Amygdala in Memory

- Amygdala was also removed in HM's brain.
- Amygdala (X) -> Fear (X)
- Amygdala -> Strong emotion -> Remember emotionally intense experience
- Amygdala enhances the consolidation and retrieval of memories associated with emotional events.

## Retrograde Amnesia

- Loss of already remembered memory.
- [Consolidation from hippocampal-Cortical to Cortico-Cortical Network Memories](images/consolidation.png)
  - The hippocampus is only involved in memory for some time and then it's no longer necessary.
  - Frankland, P. W., & Bontempi, B. (2005). The organization of recent and remote memories. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 6(2), 119-130.
- It seems very interesting that in what encoding hippocampus sends to neocortext.

## Amnesiac Patients

- Two patients.

## Memory Systems

- [Memoery classification](images/memory-classification.png)
- **Measures of memory**
  - Explicit memory
    - Recall, cued recall, recognition
  - Implicit memory
    - Skill learning, repetition priming, conditioning

## Procedural Memory and Huntington's Disease

- Declarative memory
  - Directly accessible to conscious recollection
  - Facts, episodes
  - Knowing 'what'
- Procedural memory
  - Accessible only through performance
  - Knowing 'How'
- The Stroop effect is a psychological phenomenon that describes the delay in reaction time when naming the color of a word that is a different color than the word itself.
- Mirror drawing test
  - HM could learn how to mirror-draw.
  - HM's declarative memory does not work.
- Huntington's disease
  - Unstoppable involuntary movement
  - Impaired basal ganglia
  - The patients cannot form procedural memory and cannot improve movement.

## Repetition Priming and Alzheimer's Disease

- **Repetition priming**
  - A way of unconscious learning
  - See STAR. See ST__. Come up with STAR.
  - = a psychological phenomenon that occurs when a stimulus is repeatedly presented, leading to faster and more accurate responses
  - HM can have the effect of repetition priming.
  - AD patients do not show the effect of repetition priming.
  - The neocortex, particularly regions involved in sensory and perceptual processing, is essential for repetition priming.
- **Alzheimer's disease** (AD)
  - We don't really know exactly what causes Alzheimer's with scientific certainty.
  - Hippocampus is first affected and most affected in the brain under AD. The symptoms of AD is similar to those of HM. But AD also causes bad performance on auto-completion, which is done well by HM and govern by short-term memory.
  - Physiological features of Alzheimer's disease
    - Neuronal cell death in the hippocampus and cortex
    - Amyloid plaques
    - Neurofibrillary tangles
  - Behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer's disease
    - Memory problems
    - Impairments in thinking and planning
    - Language difficulties

## Summary

- 3 memory systems
  - Explicit/Declarative memory
    - Patient info: Amnesia
    - Neural system: Medial temporal lobe
  - Skill learning
    - Patient info: Huntington's disease
    - Neural system: Basal ganglia
  - Repetition priming
    - Patient info: Alzheimer's disease
    - Neural system: Neocortex
- Memory is not equally distributed, but specially distributed in different parts.
