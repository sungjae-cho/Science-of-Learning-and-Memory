# 1. Learning

- Generalization, habituation, sensitization
- **Operant conditioning**
  - = **instrumental conditioning** (relevant to shaping)
  - = a learning process in which behaviors are influenced by their consequences.
    - Reinforcement: Increases the likelihood of a behavior being repeated.
    - Punishment: Decreases the likelihood of a behavior being repeated.
    - Neutral Operants: Responses from the environment that neither increase nor decrease the likelihood of a behavior.
    - Schedules of Reinforcement: The timing and frequency of reinforcement play a crucial role in shaping behavior.
  - Examples:
    - A teacher gives students praise for completing assignments, encouraging them to continue their efforts.
    - A dog learns to sit on command to receive a treat (positive reinforcement).
    - A person avoids touching a hot stove after getting burned once (positive punishment).
- The steps of operant conditioning:
  1. Antecedents
  2. Behavior
  3. Consequences
- **Instrumental conditioning**
- Thorndike's law of effect
  - Consequence of a response determines whether it is strengthed or weakened.
  - Learning = Behavior + Consequences
  - Good consequence -> More frequent behavior
  - Bad consequence -> Less frequent behavior
- **Fear conditioning**
  - Neutral stimulus + Fear stimulus -> Feel fear
  - Neutral stimulus -> Feel fear
- Behaviorism: Stimulus (environment) -> Response (behavior)
- **Reinforcement**
  - **Partial-reinforcement Effect**:
    - Partial reinforcement is more resistant to extinction than full reinforcement.
- **Seligman's Learned Helplessness**
  - If a stimulus is conditioned not to be removed, then the agent experience becomes helpless about change the stimuli.
  - **Resilience**: Things can change.
  - **Helplessness**: Things canoot change.

## Limits to Conditioning

- **Preparedness**
  - Preparedness is a phenomenon where we experience stronger conditioning if we think two stimuli are similar to each other. For instance, people and animals are more predisposed to fear certain stimuli.
  - Stronger conditioning with shock for pictures of snakes/sider pairs (prepared to learn) than flowers/mushrooms pairs (not prepared to learn).
  - snakes/sider: Humans are well prepared to condition this pair.
  - flowers/mushrooms: Humans are NOT well prepared to condition this pair.

  - [Preparedness: little albert](images/preparedness-little-albert.png)
  - [Preparedness: alertness](images/preparedness-alertness.png)
- (electric show, lights + noise) is well associated.
- (x-ray, sweetened water) is well associated.
- The other pairs are not well associated.
- The resulting responses for each pair are similar, resulting in better conditioning.

### Latent Learning

- = a type of learning that occurs without any immediate observable behavior changes or reinforcement but becomes evident later when there is an opportunity or motivation to demonstrate it
- Real enviroments usually give sparse rewards. Laten learning is necessary.

### Contingency

- Humans love **contingency**, feeling that we have some control over our environment. This is intrinsically rewarding.

### Language Learning

- Language learning does not seem conditioning.

### Reward and Motivation

- Negative Contrast Effect ([slide](images/negative-contrast-effect.png))
- Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Motivation: When rewards harm ([slide](images/when-rewards-harm.png))
  - Even though intrinsic rewards exist, after assigning extrinsic rewards together to the behavior, the creature loses its intrinsic motivation.
  - Less motivation leads to less efforct and more errors.
  - Intrinsic motivation is accurately entangled with its cue. The cue itself can excite the organism.
